## Evaluation Summary for tool02_Identifying and Tracking Solar Magnetic Flux Elements with Deep Learning

### Attempted Setup
- Created a new virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`
- Activated it using `source venv/Scripts/activate`
- Attempted installation via: pip install --no-cache-dir --use-pep517 -r clean_requirements.txt

### Issues Encountered
- Package `puccinialin` could not be found on PyPI:
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement puccinialin (from versions: none)
- `notebook` module also failed to install; possibly due to dependencies or PyPI resolution issues.
- Environment was using outdated pip version 20.2.1, but pip upgrade also threw permissions errors.
- Tried running `python -m notebook`, but error: `No module named notebook`

### Conclusion
Notebook could not be evaluated due to:
- Missing/invalid dependencies (e.g., `puccinialin`)
- Broken or incomplete requirement list
- Incompatible pip version or environment issues

### Suggested Action
- Confirm with the tool's original author if `puccinialin` is a real package or a typo.
- Rebuild or simplify `requirements.txt` if possible.
