https://zenodo.org/records/7506997#.Y7cEzRXMK3A

## Evaluation Summary for tool03_Predicting_Solar_Flares_with_Machine_Learning

### What Was Done

1. **Downloaded and extracted** the ZIP archive from (https://zenodo.org/records/7506997#.Y7cEzRXMK3A) into the designated folder:  
   `CCSC-Tool-Evaluations/tool03_Predicting_Solar_Flares_with_Machine_Learning/`.

2. **Verified contents** of the extracted folder:
   - Jupyter notebooks:  
     - `cscc_FlareML.ipynb`  
     - `YA_01_PredictingSolarFlareswithMachineLearning.ipynb`
   - `environment.yml` file
   - Multiple Python scripts: `flareml_train.py`, `flareml_test.py`, `flareml_utils.py`
   - Folders: `data/`, `models/`, `logs/`, `results/`, `custom_models/`
   - Supporting documentation: `README.md`, `LICENSE`

3. **Created the environment** using:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   
4. **Activated environment**:
   conda activate cscc_flareml
   
6. **Attempted to launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   jupyter notebook

### Problem Identified: Jupyter Notebook File Tree Does Not Render
Although Jupyter Notebook launched and opened the browser at http://localhost:8892/tree, the interface failed to display the file browser or any directory content. 
The page showed only the Jupyter logo and remained blank.

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken
Waited several minutes in case of slow loading — no change.
Refreshed browser and performed hard reload (Ctrl+F5) — issue persisted.
Launched Jupyter Notebook multiple times — same result.
Ensured correct directory was active when launching.
Verified successful environment activation and dependencies installed.
No visible error messages in terminal after jupyter notebook command.

### Possible Causes
Jupyter Notebook may be incompatible with older Python (3.6) environments.
Browser caching or frontend rendering errors could be disrupting UI.
Kernel/environment mismatch or broken symlink to jupyter.exe.
Extension or frontend rendering issue related to old Jupyter version.
Port conflict or reused cache from prior sessions.

###  Outcome
The tool environment was successfully created and activated.
Jupyter launched, but the UI failed to display the file tree or notebooks.
The issue may block basic usage for non-technical users.
Evaluation could not proceed due to inability to access notebook contents.

### Deliverables Verified
Environment created: cscc_flareml
Files extracted and organized correctly
Jupyter Notebook not usable due to frontend rendering failure

### Suggested Action
Try launching Jupyter in a different browser (Firefox/Edge/private tab).
Clear browser cache or try --port=8893 to avoid port reuse:
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8893
Open the notebook in VS Code or JupyterLab as a workaround.
Confirm if the tool supports modern Python (>=3.8) and update environment.yml accordingly.
Log this frontend loading issue as a critical usability limitation in the tool's documentation.
